# SAMASYS LOAN APP<br>
Hi there âœŒ <br>
Welcome to the Samasys loan app.<br><br>

## Available Features
1. Add Employees.
2. View all Employees.
3. View Individual Employee profile - with a mocked list of loans for each month.
4. Delete an Employee.
5. Real time errors while filling the form to create an employee.
6. Working navigation menus for **mobile** and **desktop** screens

## Improvements / Considerations made
1. I built seperate menus for **Desktop** and **mobile** screens to properly navigate the application.
2. Pagination of the employees listing.
3. I added alerts / notifications for actions made on the application.
4. Toasts for passing error or success messages to the user.
5. A screen for displaying friendly message when an admin attempts to view an invalid employee.<br>
To test this, Open [https://samasys.vercel.app/employees/listings/1](https://samasys.vercel.app/employees/listings/1)
6. If there are no more employees in state, a similar screen like in number **4** is displayed.
7. I added a 404 Page for missing pages / resources.

                   
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
