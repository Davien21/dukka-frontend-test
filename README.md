# SAMASYS LOAN APP<br>
Hi there âœŒ <br>
Welcome to the Samasys loan app.<br><br>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.<br><br>

### Features Built
1. Add Employees
2. View all Employees - with pagination.
3. View Individual Employee profile - with a mocked list of loans for each month.
4. Delete an Employee.

### Improvements / Considerations I made
1. I built seperate menus for **Desktop** and **mobile** screens to properly use available screen real estate.
2. I added alerts / notifications for actions made on the application.
3. Toasts for passing error or success messages to the user.
4.
